# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 23, 2023 
##### Installing Laravel
**Today's Progress**: To start fresh,  uninstalled existing Laravel along with PHP, composer and Laragon.

**Thoughts:** I wanted to re-install Laravel without without third-party apps like Laragon or Xampp to get familiar with the installation process and more. it was a failure.

### Day 2: October 24, 2023
##### Installing Laravel II

**Today's Progress**: Giving it a last try.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with the installation. I tried with multiple PHP versions but there was always a problem with php.init file. at this point I got stressed and deiced to use Laragon, as my internet connection is not helpful these days which made the process even longer and more painful.

### Day 3: October 25, 
##### Laravel has been installed successfully!

**Today's Progress**: Installed Laravel and created few routes

**Thoughts**: Installed Laragon which is universal development helper, meaning, I can create Laravel with a click lol. so I made few routs and learned how basic, named and parameterized routes work. I got stuck for few minutes on the parameter routing but I got the hang of it.

### Day 4 & 5: October 28, 
##### Laravel Controller & Model

**Today's Progress**: Created a controller and Model

**Thoughts**: Today I made 2 controllers.
1: controller to show a view,
2- controller to show data dynamically from Model.
I learned that I have to add "use path/to/file.php" to gain access
to the properties of that file, in my case was to gain access to Model
properties. and I learned that I have to use "url()"
insteed of "route()" method if the route is not using the "named()" method in routes.

at this point I can make view, controller, and Model and connect 
them all together to show data dynamically. tomorrow will start to 
learn how to interact with database.
